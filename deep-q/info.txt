one hidden layer -> neural network
two or more hidden layers -> deep neural network

Neural Networks:
They are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node connects 
to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, 
that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network.
convolutional neural networks now provide a more scalable approach to image classification and object recognition tasks, leveraging principles 
from linear algebra, specifically matrix multiplication, to identify patterns within an image.


Keras Models:
Sequential Model - allows us to create models layer by layer in sequential order. Allows for 1 input tensor and 1 output tensor.

Functional Model- allows us to add layers. Create models that have multiple input or output.

Adam Optimizer - combination of RMSProp and Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum
